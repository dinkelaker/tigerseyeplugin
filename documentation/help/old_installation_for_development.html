<h1>Configuration of Eclipse for Tigerseye Eclipse Plug-in Development</h1>
<h2>Eclipse installation</h2>
<p>
	Originally Eclipse 3.4 was used the current branch is tested with Eclipse 3.6 (PDE)	
</p>
<p>
	The legacy Groovy Plug-in Version is 1.5.7.
	The Groovy Plug-ins are all available in the repository and have to be used from there, for tigerseye development, since some sources the plug-in depends on have been modified.
	(Official update-site is http://dist.codehaus.org/groovy/distributions/update/)
</p>
<p>
	Groovy uses TestNG. The used library is available in one of the Groovy Plug-ins.
	A compatible version Eclipse plug-in of TestNG is no longer distributed from the above stated update-site. The official TestNG version for eclipse 3.4.2 does not seem to work for every installation instead the following update-site provides a version which worked for me after minor code modifications.
	http://beust.com/eclipse-old/eclipse-5.14.1.6/
</p>

<h2>Possible Problems</h2>
	When using Eclipse 3.4 it is possible that at some point an error of the following kind appears:
<pre>
	org.eclipse.swt.SWTError: XPCOM error -2147221164
	at org.eclipse.swt.browser.Browser.error(Browser.java:1328)
	at org.eclipse.swt.browser.Browser.<init>(Browser.java:235)
</pre>
	or
<pre>
	java.lang.RuntimeException: Widget disposed too early!
	at org.eclipse.ui.internal.WorkbenchPartReference$1.widgetDisposed(WorkbenchPartReference.java:153)
	at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.TypedListener.handleEvent(TypedListener.java:101)
</pre>
	A solution is to adjust the used Xulrunner. To do that simply add the path to your xulrunner installation. In your developement envrionment as well as in an Eclipse target environment (if both are 3.4).
	For Example add the following line when using a debian based linux distribution:
<pre>
	-Dorg.eclipse.swt.browser.XULRunnerPath=/usr/lib/xulrunner
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Intalling the Tigerseye Plug-in</h2>
<p>
	 The Version 1.0.0 of Tigerseye plugin can be installed from a local update-site with the software update mechanism of Eclipse.
