<h2>Transformation produces weird constructs such as
&quot;???&quot;</h2>
<p>Weird constructs in translated tigerseye output file. Instead of
a special character some construct like &quot;???&quot; appears in the
translated file. Possibly the used encoding is not consistent. A
solution that always worked for me was to set everything to utf8.
Setting the file encoding default in the preferences is the easiest way
to do this.</p>
<h2>MemoryOutOfBounds PermGenSize (Known issue when using Eclipse
3.4 and 3.6)</h2>
<p>A solution that worked for me was to simply increase the
PermGenSize as this should now be already the case in the Tigersey_IDE launch configuration</p>
