	<h1>Logging Framwork for Tigerseye</h1>
	<p>The applied logging framework for Tigerseye is sfl4j. It is a java logging facade making the application independant from a concrete logging framework.
	</p>
	
	<h2>The configuration</h2>
	<p>		
		In general the code that wants to use the slf4j facade only needs a dependency on the slf4j-api library and has to state an import for the org.slf4j.imp package. The finally used logging framework is determined on what binding has been set by the user on the classpath. Of course the corresponding framework has to be on the classpath as well.
		So if log4j is to be used with sfl4j the sfl4j-log4j12 binding has to be put on the classpath and a logj4-1.2 library as well.
		The configuration of the log4j framework than happens globally by setting a property for the virtual machine. (-Dlog4j.configurations=location; the location is interpreted 	product relative, todo more specific on different place).
	</p>
	<h3>Setting up the plug-ins</h3>
	<p>
		The concrete bindings are provided through seperate plug-ins. Per binding must only be one plug-in on the eclipse classpath, to circumvent conflicts, since every of the plug-ins has to export the same packages, s.t. the plug-in that uses the facade framework can access the currently installed logger framework.
		The slf-api library has to be available in every binding plug-in. Although it is the same library it can not be distributed as a seperate plug-in due to cycles in the slf4j package hierarchy. The general slf4j api must access the concrete binding implementation which again needs access to the slf4j api to extend the provided interfaces and base classes.
	</p>
	<h3>Configuration in particular</h3>
	<p>
		The plug-ins have to be set to Buddy-ActivationPolicy: lazy, which corresponds with Activate plug-in when one of its classes is loaded.
	</p>
	<h4>Log4j configuration</h4>
	<p>
		If it a custom appender for log4j is desired a few more configurations have to be considered. Log4j configures itself (assuming it found a working properties file) when its API is used for the first time. If a custom appender has been configured the log4j plug-in must have access to it at this moment. Since it can not know which plug-in wishes to support a custom appender it must be able search for it in the classpaths of the plug-ins wishing to extend it. This is made possible upon the OSGI framework using a Buddy Policy. In the log4j plug-in MANIFEST.MF the a line Eclipse-BuddyPolicy: registered has to be set. In every plug-in which provides an appender the line Eclipse-RegisterBuddy: org.apache.log4j has to be added. This technique is possibly deprecated but still works and does not cause any warnings from Eclipse in the MANIFEST.MF file.
		By applying those two properties the log4j plug-in has itself registered to be able to use an unknown extended classpath and the contributor plug-in has agreed to make its classpath accessible for its &quot;Buddies&quot;.
	</p>
	<h4>Custom PDE slf4j Binding</h4>
	<p>
		It is possible to define custom sfl4j binder with relatively little effort. A plug-in has been provided which binds directly binds the sfl4j api with the eclipse pde logging system without employing any further logging frameworks. This plug-in has been inspired through the article by John Franey (see Related Articles). Since it was written for an earlier version of sfl4j it had to be adjusted to the used version 1.6.1 of sfl4j and the dependencies to the apache.commons.io.logging system have been removed.
		The plug-in offers an extension point (org.sfl4j.pde.logger) on which other plug-ins can register themselves, which is necessary so that the plug-in can log for the specific plug-ins.
		If they use the sfl4j library their loggings will be transfered over the sfl4j pde plugin to the pde logging system.
		The Levels Debug and Trace are mapped to IStatus.OK, Levels INFO, WARNING AND ERROR to the according IStatus severities.
		The extension points support the possibility to define a regular expression which describes the names of the loggers which ought to be forwarded to the pde logging.
