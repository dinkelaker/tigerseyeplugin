<h1>Known Issues</h1>
<h2>Java files can not be launched directly</h2>
<p>If a correct Java file is generated the Groovy launcher is able
to launch it sometimes. But it occurs that some constructs valid within
a Java file are not valid when launching it as a Groovy file. It would
be desirable to directly launch such a file as simple Java file.</p>
<h3>Possible solution</h3>
<p>Use JDT launcher for pure Java files. Maybe its beneficial to
implement separate CompilationUnits for Tigerseye projects?</p>
<h2>Groovy nature not added when tigerseye nature available</h2>
<h3>Possible solution</h3>
<p>The given project can be checked for
file.getProject().hasNature(Groovy_Nature). An appropriate warning
should be emitted if that's the case instead of an unknown behavior.</p>
<h2>Legacy Groovy transformation not always launchable</h2>
<p>The Groovy 2.1. plug-in can sometimes not launch the transformed
files. No Syntax error is reported on the generated files though.</p>
<h3>Example error message:</h3>
<pre>
 TODO
</pre>
<h2>If file not transformed launch not possible</h2>
<p>If an output file does not exist when trying to launch a
Tigerseye file it should be forced to perform a build before actually
launching the file.</p>
<h2>No Test Suite</h2>
<p>The current implementation has nothing like a test suite. Some
test cases exist. One set tests the correct translation of example
files. A few other unit tests test some modules of the Tigerseye Plug-in</p>
<p>At least some sort of regression test-suite consisting of a few
important system tests should be available.</p>
<p>A better solution would be a comprehensive set of unit tests,
executable without the necessity of a running eclipse platform or any
other dependent on system. An example of how to develop test suites for
the tigerseye plug-in are the tests provided by the Groovy plug-in for
eclipse. Since the Tigerseye Plug-in extends many parts of Groovy those
tests partially showcase how to write tests for a concrete tigerseye
module</p>
<h2>No Documentation</h2>
<p>A few functionalities are described, in particular generating a
knew DSL using the new DSL wizard. Apart from that no documentation of
functionalities nor the architecture is available. For developers
maintaining or extending the plug-in such documentation would be a great
help. New functionality could be developed in less time since no
extensive study of big parts of the plug-in's code base would be
necessary to understand the important parts for a change or extension.</p>
<h3>Possible TODOs</h3>
<p>Write some use cases describing the provided functionality</p>
<h2>Popart -UI and -Refactoring Plug-ins not ported</h2>
<p>This is one of the next step in order to have completely ported
all tigerseye specific developed functionality from the legacy popart
plug-in.</p>
<h2>Not satisfied implicit dependencies of DSLs</h2>
<p>DSLs use annotations to describe the language. If some
annotations are not accessible on the classpath the DSL can not be
correctly parsed and transformed. There should be some mechanism to warn
at least emit a error message if such a dependency is missing. otherwise
it is difficult to debug such a problem, since it is unknown whether the
language itself is incorrect or the translation algorithm. Both are not
trivial to debug. The annotations have to be available in the DSL
contributing plug-in. Why is it not sufficient if they are available for
the transformer? When the language is actually processed?</p>
<h2>What are the definite dependencies of DSLs</h2>
<p>There exist different implementations the same or similar classes which are used
by the DSL contributing plug-ins. One set should suffice and would make the code
clearer.</p>
<h3>Dependencies</h3>
<ul>
<li>de.tud.stg.popart.dslsupport Package (in particular the DSL marker interface)</li>
<li>de.tud.stg.popart.builder.core.annotations</li>
<li>de.tud.stg.popart.builder.core.aterm</li>
<li>de.tud.stg.popart.builder.core.typeHandling</li>
<li>de.tud.stg.popart.builder.eclipse.EDSL</li>
<li>de.tud.stg.popart.eclipse.core.debug.*  ,.annotations.PopartType, .handler.*, .model.keywords.* available as source and in popartAnnotations</li>
<li>Same classes are partially provided in source and in library so for the classes in popart.jar</li>
</ul>
<h2>DSLs in property store should have names derived from DSL classes</h2>
<p>The current scheme just increases a number for each language that is added to properties.
This scheme would provide ambiguous defined languages and forces to iterate over all saved 
file within the property store to find the one currently searched for. The fully qualified name
of the DSL defining class would be good alternative to the current scheme.</p>
<p>One possible problem though would be how to handle no longer available languages. A further 
indirection could be used to store all currently available languages.</p>
<h3>For example</h3>
<ol>
<li>allLangKeys -&gt; [DSLKey...];</li>
<li>DSLKey -&gt; [name,contributor,color,transformer...]</li>
</ol>
