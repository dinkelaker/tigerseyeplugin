<h1>The Launch Process</h1>
<p>I will give a short Overview about the different concepts for the
launch process. For a more detailed introduction one should read the
references.</p>
<p>In the end all that happens is that a Java process is called with
specified parameters for the classpath and the virtual machine, using
the <tt>Runtime.exec()</tt> method. But to define all the necessary
parameters and to offer the possibility for the user to define specific
properties using a UI is cumbersome and already provided by the Eclipse
Framework.</p>
<h2>Launch Configuration</h2>
<p>The <tt>Launch Configuration</tt> is an object carrying all the
parameters for the resulting <tt>Java</tt> call.
<p>
<h2>Launch Delegate</h2>
<p>The <tt>Launch Delegate</tt> is the final class that will usually
be called with a configured Launch Configuration. It analyzes the passed
configuration and builds the JVM parameters accordingly. It is possible
to pass parameters via the launch configuration which act as place
holder for some default configurations. For example it is possible to
define that all classes on the project's classpath should also be passed
to the VM which will be usually the case. The delegate won't directly
invoke the Runtime.exec() method but instead use the VMRunner
(representing a Java virtual machine) to execute a specific JRE. The
JavaLaunchDelegate offers already most of the necessary functionality
for Tigerseye. The only additional configurations are to pass the
transformed Java types instead of the DSL types.</p>
<h2>The Launch Configuration Type</h2>
<p>The Type represents a special kind of executable data object. A
Launch Configuration will be seen in the Run Launch Configurations
Dialog. Since Tigerseye doesn't launch it's DSL files but instead
transforms them to groovy or Java files which will be then build and be
executable class files most of the functionality offered for launching a
Java file can be reused. The only necessary adjustment is the Main tab
which shows the selected DSL file instead of a Java class type.</p>
<h2>The Launch Shortcut</h2>
<p>Most of the times the user will want to launch his application
with some default values without bothering to first open the Run
Configurations Dialog and then select the file and then to launch it.
For that purpose a Launch Shortcut can be created. It will be in context
menu of a DSL file in the package explorer or in its Editor. If a launch
configuration for some file already exists this should be reused
otherwise some default configuration should be created with which the
transformed DSL file will be executed.</p>

<h1>The implementation</h1>
<p>Tigerseye supports the generation of Java file as well as of
Groovy files. Depending on which transformed file type has to be
launched different launch configurations have to be chosen. When
launching a Java file the default configurations should be enough, i.e.
extending or just reusing the JavaLaunchDelegate would be enough to only
support that case. To support launching Groovy scripts the classpath has
to be set accordingly and the actual type to start is not the groovy
file but rather the GroovyStarter which can make dynamic adjustments
which will make the transformed file launch-able.</p>
<p>Different DSLs might need different Groovy configurations, which is not always self explanatory.</p>
