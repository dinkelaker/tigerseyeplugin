<h1>TODO is now part of core plug-in<br />Tigerseye DSL Builder Plug-in</h1>
<h2>Plug-in id: <tt>de.tud.stg.popart.builder</tt></h2>
<p>de.tud.stg.popart.builder plug-in. Is responsible to build the
tigerseye files, which are identified through the ending <tt>.dsl</tt>.
The files can be a mixture of different languages. These are identified
endings before the <tt>.dsl</tt> ending. For example <tt>myclsss.java.sql.dsl</tt>
</p>
<p>To extend the incremental build capabilities of eclipse the
Tigerseye builder uses the &quot;Incremental Project Builders&quot;
extension. The extension identifier is <tt>org.eclipse.core.resources.builders</tt>
The incremental tigerseye builder is automatically executed when a
resource changes within a project marked with the tigerseye nature.</p>
<p>In order to work a project which desires to use tigerseye needs
to add the Tigerseye Nature to its project. This will add the three core
libraries which parse the source and convert it into a groovy file, the
<em>Tigerseye Runtime Library</em>, consisting of the following files:
<ul>
	<li>popart.jar (Possible not necessary, since functionality
	provided through the plug-in itself)</li>
	<li>edslNature.jar</li>
	<li>popartAnnotations.jar</li>
</ul>

Subsequently a Groovy file is invoked which executes the generated
groovy file.</p>
<p>The execution happens using the PopartLauncher. The
PopartLauncher gets the files with the possibly multiple extensions
derives according to a scheme the name of the actual groovy files within
the folder that contains the generated sourcecode. Then the calculated
file name is given to the GroovyLaunchShortcut which invokes the groovy
execution on those files. Three cases are differentiated. If the file is
originally a Java, a Groovy or a Embedded DSL file. In the first two
cases the original tools can handle the files without further
computation.</p>
<h2>Transformation</h2>
<p>The transformation process takes a DSL file from the source
directory of an Tigerseye Plug-in and transforms it accordingly to the
configured transformers. The generated file is saved in an intermediate
source directory from which the files are launched with an appropriate
second launcher. In particular this will be the groovy launcher or the
JDT launcher.</p>
<h3>Naming Scheme</h3>
<p>The 2.1.XXX version of the Groovy plug-in no longer supports
files with dots in the middle of the file name. Accordingly the
transformed file name has to avoid this. Additionally the groovy
launcher is not able to execute all java files. So the JDT launcher has
to be used the launch them.</p>
