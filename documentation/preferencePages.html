<h1>Languages</h1>
<p>
	The languages page provides the configuration interface for installed DSLs.
	To introduce new DSLs plug-ins are used which extend the popartLanguages Extension Point.
	Those are automatically found, but have to be set manually in the languages preference page before the Popart Plug-in knows how to build specific languages with specific extensions.
	When in language preference page a dsl can be added with the new button. A dialog appears where all available DSLs are listed.
	In this diaolog the extension has to be set to the according DSL defining class.
	<br />
	Then transformations specific to the DSL can be defined using when clicking on the &quot;Transformations&quot; button.
	Dependent on the type of DSL and used Annotations different transformers must be chosen so that the Popart Plug-in can process the DSL correctly.
