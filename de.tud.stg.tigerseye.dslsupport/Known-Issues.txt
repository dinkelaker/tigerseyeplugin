# Library generation.

During development the library 

    lib/tigerseye-support.jar
    
is not in sync with the actual source code-base.
So if something is changed in the `de.tud.stg.tigerseye.dslsupport` plug-in
and it is supposed to be accessed
from a test Eclipse instance the library has to be updated manually.

## Update the `tigerseye-support` Jar File

To do so simply run the `update-tigerseye-support.jardesc` file.
This will replace the current support library with the classes of the currently compiled files
from the support source directory. 

or use the PDE Export Wizard.
1.  Let him deploy the plug-in somewhere,
2.  If you have deployed the complete plug-in as JAR expand it,
3.  go to the `lib` directory and copy `tigerseye-support.jar` to the actual plug-in `lib` directory.
    (Probably overwrite an older version.)
