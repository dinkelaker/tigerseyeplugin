The Tigerseye Plug-in Project

The repository contains the tigerseye-plugin bundles.
Additionally some example language plug-ins are provided
and a project that showcases use of those.
The Plug-in has a dependency to parlex, an Earley-Parser 
implementation, which is contained in a different repository.
Without the correct parlex project the Plug-in can not be build.
