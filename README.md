# The Tigerseye Plug-in Project

The repository contains the **Tigerseye-Plugin Bundles**.
Additionally some *example language plug-ins* are provided
and a project that showcases the use of those.

The Tigerseye Plug-in has a dependency to **parlex**, an *Earley-Parser* 
implementation, which is contained in a different repository.
Without the correct parlex project the Plug-in can not be build.
